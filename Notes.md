In this example I learned 

* the value of TDD 
* Understanding the cycle of
    * Write a test
    * Make the compiler pass
    * Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
    * Write enough code to make the test pass
    * Refactor

## Some of the Go syntax learned here

* Writing tests
* Declaring functions, with arguments and return types
* if, const and switch
* Declaring variables and constants
